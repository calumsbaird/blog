# Are We Underestimating AI?

---

There is a sentiment that “The AI situation is well understood and
perfectly under control”. Though comforting, this couldn’t be further from the truth.
Advances in AI are kicking off an explosion of technological innovation that will drive the
next industrial revolution with unprecedented scale and speed. My aim with this piece of
writing is to convince you that this is likely and that we are ill prepared. In the pursuit of
truth, an open dialogue that directly addresses skepticism is essential. If we are better
informed, we will make better decisions when facing the challenges of the coming
decade.
